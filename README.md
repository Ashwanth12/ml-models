# Machine Learning Models Repository

A collection of machine learning projects and models for various use cases. Each project is self-contained with its own documentation, data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation scripts.

## Projects

### Customer Churn Prediction
Predict customer churn using machine learning models.

- **Features:**
  - Synthetic data generation
  - Multiple model comparison (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
  - Model performance visualization
  - Churn probability prediction
- **Location:** `/customer_churn_prediction`
- **Key Files:**
  - `data_preparation.py`: Generate and preprocess synthetic customer data
  - `model_training.py`: Train and compare multiple models
  - `predict.py`: Make churn predictions
  - `README.md`: Detailed project documentation

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ashwanth12/ml-models.git
cd ml-models
```

2. Create a virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Navigate to specific project
```bash
cd customer_churn_prediction  # or other project directory
```

5. Follow project-specific README for detailed instructions

## Best Practices
- Each project follows a modular structure
- Comprehensive documentation
- Model performance evaluation
- Code quality and readability
- Version control for both code and models
